We use two different servers to acheive this\n\n\n\n\nmmserver/mmserver.py\n : Python flask server to provide a REST interface so a web browser can retrieve Map Manager annotations and images\n\n\nmmclient/index.html\n : A front end point-and-click web-browser interface allowing Map Manager annotations and images to be visualized.\n\n\n\n\n1) Installing software to run the servers\n\n\nThe \nmmserver/mmserver.py\n Flask REST server requires the following Python libraries\n\n\npip install flask\npip install flask-cors\npip install scikit-image\n\n\n\n\nRunning the servers requires \ngunicorn\n for the mmserver Flask REST server and \nhttp-server\n for the mmclient server.\n\n\npip install gunicorn\n\n# this assumes you have node and npm install\nnpm install http-server -g\n\n\n\n\nThis is only one way of running these two servers. If you want to run them a different way you are free to do this.\n\n\n2) Starting the client/server for local use (basic)\n\n\nStart both unicorn and http-server with our \nPyMapManager/serve_local.sh\n script.\n\n\nThis will work well if you are only going to be browsing the client/server from the same machine. This will work on MacOS (and Linux).\n\n\nStart the servers with\n\n\ncd PyMapManager\n./serve_local.sh start\n\n\n\n\nStop the servers with\n\n\ncd PyMapManager\n./serve_local.sh stop\n\n\n\n\n3) Manually start both client and server servers\n\n\nStart the \nmmserver/mmserver.py\n REST server\n\n\ncd mmserver\npython mmserver.py\n\n\n\n\nTest this out by pointing a web browser to\n\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:5010/help\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, start the \nmmserver.py\n REST server with gunicorn\n\n\ncd mmserver\ngunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:5010 mmserver:app\n\n\n\n\nWrapping the \nmmserver\n to run inside of gunicorn provides a \nsynchronous\n web server. This should handle fast interaction with the web interface much better than the \nasynchronous\n version provided by \npython mmserver.py\n. This is most noticeable when viewing linked sliding z-projections.\n\n\nStart the \nmmclient/index.html\n client server\n\n\nThis is assuming you have node and npm installed. In addition, we are assuming you have used npm to install http-server with \nnpm install http-server -g\n.\n\n\nMake sure \nmmclient/static/mmserver.js\n points to the REST interface. This file should have\n\n\nserverurl = 'http://127.0.0.1:5010/'\n\n\n\n\nRun the mmclient client server\n\n\ncd mmclient\nhttp-server\n\n\n\n\nThe output should look like this\n\n\nStarting up http-server, serving ./\nAvailable on:\n  http://127.0.0.1:8080\n  http://192.168.1.10:8080\nHit CTRL-C to stop the server\n\n\n\n\nYou can then browse the client server at\n\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8080\n\n\n\n\n4) Running the client/server on a Linux system with an existing web-server\n\n\nThis requires a pre-existing web server to serve both the client server \nmmclient/index.html\n and the Python Flask REST server \nmmserver/mmserver.py\n.\n\n\nWe have used \nnginx\n with success.\n\n\n\n\nGet a debian system\n\n\nInstall nginx\n\n\n\n\nsudo apt-get install nginx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the \nmmclient/\n folder into \n/var/www/html/mmclient\n\n\n\n\nsudo cp PyMapManager/mmclient /var/www/html/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now access the mmclient as http://nginx_server_ip/mmclient\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the client in \nmmclient/static/mmserver.js\n is pointing to the REST server (we will run that next).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsudo pico /var/www/html/mmclient/static/mmserver.js\n\n# make sure the file has\nserverurl = 'http://nginx_server_ip:5010/'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the Flask server with\n\n\n\n\ncd mmserver\nscreen\ngunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5010 mmserver:app\n# exit screen with ctrl+a then d \n\n\n\n\nThis runs the Flask app \napp\n in the python file \nmmserver.py\n at the address \nhttp://nginx_server_ip:5010\n. We have used \nscreen\n so that when you logout of the terminal, the server continues to run. If you need to stop the server, you can use \nPyMapManager/serve_local.sh stop\n or return to the \nscreen\n session with \nscreen -r\n and hit ctrl+c.\n\n\nCheck the REST server manually by browsing to\n\n\nhttp://nginx_server_ip:5010/help\n\n\n\n\nIf that all works, you can browse some maps at\n\n\nhttp://nginx_server_ip/mmclient\n\n\n\n\nThis will serve the \nmmclient/index.html\n and use the \nmmclient/static/mmserver.js\n file. The \nmmclient/static/mmserver.js\n file will grab annotations and images from the \nmmserver/mmserver.py\n Python Flask REST server via \nhttp://nginx_server_ip:5010\n.",
